pForth Hacks
============

Custom functions and other additions to the
[pForth][PFORTH] implementation of the [Forth programming language][FORTH].

Initial plans are:

* Forth words for interacting with Objective-C and Cocoa.
* Use as a scripting language within iOS apps.
* Embedding pForth as a glue/scripting language within the [CLIPS expert system tool][CLIPS].
* Implementing a version of the [Warren Abstract Machine][WAM] for [Prolog][PROLOG] as Forth words or 
additions to the pForth threaded interpreter.
